# BerryBox - FCN Model Training

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This sub-directory contains code and resources to train production or
developmental version of the FCN model.

## Directory structure

**`annotatedImagesMask`** - The folder of full-size images and masks.
These are used for training the model. A dataset of images and masks can
be found here (add link).

Other folders are created by the
`trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel.py` script, including
**`train`**, **`test`**, and **`model_output`**.

## Scripts

**`trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel.py`** - a Python script to
train, test, and validate a developmental version of the FCN model. This
script is meant to be run using HPC resources.

**`run_trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel_SCINet.sh`** - a bash
script used to run the `trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel.py`
script using HPC resources from SCINet. This bash script activates a
python virtual environment so the correct CUDA version, python version,
and python libraries can be installed.

## Training a FCN Model

Edit settings in the `trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel.py`
script. You may wish to play with settings such as `num_epochs`,
`scale`, and `batch_size`. If you want to reserve some images for
testing (i.e.Â holdout), edit the `testing_fraction` setting to be
greater than zero. Once you have decided on tuning settings, set
`testing_fraction` to zero to train the production model.

To run the training script on SCINet, follow these steps:

1.  Create a virtual environment by following the [instructions
    here](https://github.com/neyhartj/FCNWorkflow/tree/master/scinet).  
2.  Add images and masks to the `annotatedImagesMask` folder.  
3.  Adjust settings (described above) in the
    `trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel.py` script.  
4.  Run the script using the command below:

<!-- -->

    sh run_trainTest_BerryBox_FCNSegmentationModel_SCINet.sh
